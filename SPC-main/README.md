## Environment 🔧

Please install these requirements:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
For inference, please also install `vllm` (we use version 0.6.6).



## Data 📚
Please find our generated training data and evaluation datasets [here](https://connecthkuhk-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/jadge_connect_hku_hk/EkB9OYBHr_tGmGeJ5xxTncgBXFnln9nPP4jmCKNcQSSDIQ?e=oF7b6g).

`data_round0_sft_critic.json` contains SFT data and `data_round2_rl_critic.json` contains data generated in rounds 1 and 2 for RL training.

The three files in `data/eval` correspond to the datasets used for evaluating the critic.

## Checkpoints 🤗

We have uploaded the trained [SFT critic model](https://huggingface.co/judge/SPC-Critic-0/tree/main) (round 0) and [RL critic model](https://huggingface.co/judge/SPC-Critic-2/tree/main) (round 2) to Hugging Face!

## Reinforcement Finetuning 🔥
You can use the provided data to finetune the SFT critic model into the round 2 critic model. 

Please modify the data and model paths in the script as needed before running:
```bash
bash scripts/rl_critic.sh
```

## Evaluation 🚀
After training a critic model or directly using our provided checkpoints, please set the dataset and checkpoint paths in the following script to perform evaluation.

```bash
python3 eval/infer_batch.py
```
